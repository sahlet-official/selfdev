### What exactly foundation means:

1. Practice
   - Practice exercises for:
     - to impact cognitive functions;
     - to choose and develop mindset (principles) that will allow me to define the foundation to live life as I want (relaxed enough, happy) and for everything what I do, in a sense, religion built not on dogmas, but on naturally formed regularities obtained by personal experience or provable ways;
     - to develop acceptance;
     - to be able to manage the degree to which environment influences my mental and emotional state;
     - to feel the sufficiency of satisfaction of basic needs;
     - to see the choice and to make a choice to do something extra (besides satisfying basic needs) or not;
   - Suppose it will be mindfulness. Actually I am already available to be happy - mindfulness helped with it. I have practiced mindfulness about year and half and have one year break. I have learned a lot over time with and without practice. Feel great potential in further development in this direction.
2. Needs Understanding
   - Set up deep understanding people's needs, use knowledge on practice for my life,
recognize a need and satisfy it directly.
3. Health
   - Set up processes for maintaining physical and mental health and system of crisis prevention.
   - Develop and integrate behavior templates that will allow me maintaining health.
   - Monitor well-being, number of parameters which allow timely detection or even prevention of deviation from the desired healthy state.
4. Limits, predispositions, talents, cautions
   - Find out what I can do, what is recommended doing (allowed) and what is not recommended doing. What are my limits, what lifestyle is optimal for me according to my initial parameters (health, type of nervous system, genetic predisposition, susceptibility to disease, some other parameters...).
5. Communication
   - Set up skills of communication with people (soft skills, emotional intelligence, oratory, rhetoric).

### Further directions will depend on what are my needs and what are my limits.
