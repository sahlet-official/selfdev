### Repository for organizing self-development process


I really interested in dive into the topic of self-development.

I tried to search the Internet for methodologies and best practices for self-development.<br>

I have seen how people write about how to make and reach goals, make themselves better, be successful and other strange things to me.
It is all not meaningless, but it is just the small part of an iceberg that cannot stay afloat without a huge underwater invisible part.
Besides goals and achievements in life, there is still a lot of things that are much more significant, valuable and interesting.
And in truth, achievements of goals can be titonically difficult without the simple ability to live.

Comparing self-development process to process of site creation - if you will focus on goals and success, then you draw design of your client-side (Frontend), but you will still need big amount of work for creating server-side (backend). And now let's see how the development of the site differs from the development of person itself: to create backend part of site you can hire one more software developer, tell him what to do, and he will do it for you. But to make real self-development maximum who you can hire is a set of consultants and coaches - it means you have to do main job by yourself, nobody except you can't change you, of course, if we discard the direct effect on the body due to surgical or medical intervention. That is why we see such cases when people not accept themselves, run to consultants, sometimes it helps (and it is really good when consultant can help you), and if consultants can not help some people try to fix their bodies with hope that after fix they will accept themselves. I will say you even more, when people unsatisfied, sometimes they can suffer, and it can push them to do things that even they themselves would not wish such things on anyone, for example: drug use, suicide, crime. So when unprepared people want to develop themselves and read about methodologies written in terminology like goals and success, for most part of these people it this will lead to an attempt to harness themselves and at the same time beckon them with a carrot and beat them in the ass with a whip, and so on until you are blue in the face.


That is why I want to start my self-development process not by setting my goals (not hang a carrot in front of me and dream about the taste of it) and then try to achieve them in the spirit of the traditional racers for success phrase "fake it until you make it". No. I don't want to look like successful. I actually even don't want to be successful (in terms of society). I want just live life with pleasure do what I want or nothing at all (which is also cool thing actually - just live and do nothing).
So I want to start with creating of really powerful strong foundation - create my "Backend" that will allow me to make the "Frontend" whatever I want. If saying in allegories: on such foundation I will be able to launch rockets, build skyscraper, malls, or just live like that and with time the foundation will be overgrown with forest (do nothing and see what's happening).
What exactly foundation means:
1. To practice exercises for:
   -to impact cognitive functions;
   -to choose and develop mindset (principles) that will allow me to define the foundation to live life as I want (relaxed enough, happy) and for everything what I do, in a sense, religion built not on dogmas, but on naturally formed regularities obtained by personal experience or provable ways;
   -to develop acceptance;
   -to be able to manage the degree to which environment influences my mental and emotional state;
   -to feel the sufficiency of satisfaction of basic needs;
   -to see the choice and to make a choice to do something extra (besides satisfying basic needs) or not;

   Suppose it will be mindfulness. Actually I am already available to be happy - mindfulness helped with it. I have practiced mindfulness about year and half and have one year break. I have learned a lot over time with and without practice. Feel great potential in further development in this direction.
2. Set up deep understanding people's needs, use knowledge on practice for my life,
recognize a need and satisfy it directly.
3. Set up processes for maintaining physical and mental health and system of crisis prevention.
   Develop and integrate behavior templates that will allow me maintaining health. Monitor a number of parameters. Allowing timely detection or even prevention of deviation from the desired healthy state.
4. Find out what I can do, what is recommended doing (allowed) and what is not recommended doing.
   What are my limits, what lifestyle is optimal for me according to my initial parameters (health, type of nervous system, genetic predisposition, susceptibility to disease, some other parameters...).
5. Set up skills of communication with people (soft skills, emotional intelligence, oratory, rhetoric).


Other directions will depend on what are my needs.
