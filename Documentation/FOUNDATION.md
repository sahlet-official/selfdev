### What exactly does foundation mean?

#### Build foundation - means setup following processes:

1. Practice
   - Practice exercises for:
     - to impact cognitive functions;
     - to learn how to develop and integrate new behavioral patterns, transform existing ones;
     - to learn to see the reserve of strength, see tempo (the rate of consumption of body resources, strength) and influence it;
     - to learn to direct strength where I want;
     - to choose and develop a mindset (principles) that will allow me to define the foundation to live life as I want, and for everything that I do, in a sense, a religion built not on dogmas, but on naturally formed regularities obtained by personal experience or provable ways;
     - to develop acceptance;
     - to be able to manage the degree to which an environment influences my mental and emotional state;
     - to feel the sufficiency of satisfaction of basic needs;
     - to see the choice and to make a choice to do something extra (besides satisfying basic needs) or not;
     - to recover the structure of inhibition so that it would be even more effective than before, could prevent excitation in the neural tissue if it is not needed now, could at the right moment in a short period of time relax the excitation in the neural tissue and maintain this relaxation for as long as necessary, or leave relaxed until arousal is needed, if needed at all;
     - to recover the relaxation structures so that it is even more effective than before, why relaxation and not braking - because there is only one pedal in the mind - this is gas. And the braking structure is also started by pressing the gas, but its job is to slow down another structure. So you still need to be able to relax the process (release the gas pedal), so that you do not have to slow it down all the time, pressing the gas pedal of the braking structure;
   - Suppose it will be mindfulness. Actually I am already available to be happy - mindfulness helped with it. I have practiced mindfulness for about a year and a half and have one year break. I have learned a lot over time with and without practice. Feel great potential for further development in this direction.
2. Needs understanding
   - Set up a deep understanding of people's needs, use the knowledge in practice for my life, recognize a need and satisfy it directly.
   - Learn to recognize which needs are more prioritized right now.
   - Learn to make time for each need.
   - To figure out if I want a high, or a non-intense happiness is enough, why I am afraid of a high, what are the consequences of feeling intense pleasant emotions, why addiction is formed.
   - To figure out if I want accomplishments, glory, greatness and power, why people want this and what are the consequences of trying to achieve such thing, am I ready for this. It feels like a desire for greatness goes hand in hand with insanity..
   - To understand whether all the actions of a person are dictated by his needs, or whether he can do something just like that.
   - Is it possible to do a big deal without ambition, what motivates people in this case, what needs do they satisfy.
   - Understand the types of motivations and understand what motive is good and what is not (for example, is it good to want fame, what is fraught with).
   - Awareness of what skills exist and what I need (which ones I want to develop, the skill-building process is also important when deciding on the need for a skill because maybe you don't want to make the process happen).
3. Health
   - Set up processes for maintaining physical and mental health and system of crisis prevention.
   - Develop and integrate behavior templates that will allow me to maintain health and mental clarity.
   - Monitor well-being. Monitor the number of parameters that allow timely detection or even prevention of deviation from the desired healthy state.
   - To understand whether the desire for glory is healthy, whether there is a desire for glory without madness, where is the line between healthy and unhealthy ambitions, and are there healthy ambitions exist.
   - Possible methods: preventive medicine, hygiene, sanitation, valeology, yoga.
4. Limits understanding, predispositions, talents, cautions, interests
   - Find out what I can do, what is recommended doing (allowed), and what is not recommended, what do I want. What are my limits, character, temperament, what lifestyle is optimal for me according to my initial parameters (health, type of nervous system, genetic predisposition, susceptibility to disease, and some other parameters...).
   - Methods:
     - genetic screening;
     - consulting with experts in the field of the work of the mind and body;
     - tests of the body, resource characteristics, potentials of opportunities, search for optimal conditions and parameters;
     - life design, prototyping, gaining experience on experimental activity models (watch Life Design course from Stanford);
5. Soft Skills
   - Set up skills of communication with people (soft skills..., emotional intelligence, oratory, rhetoric).
   - Set up skills related to perception, processing, filtering, storage and reproduction of information.
   - Set up skills related to learning and adaptation.
   - Set up an understanding of behavioral science and use it in practice.
   - Set up a voice control technique.
   - Learn to speak in public, perform on stage.
   - To master the skill of skill-building.
   - To master the skill of searching and assimilation the needed information.
   - To master the skill of simplifying the task.
   - To master the skill of rest.
   - To master the skill of prioritization.
   - To master the skill of starting a business, continuing a business, and COMPLETING a business (the most important) and emotional confirmation - satisfaction, without a feeling of emotional confirmation of completion, the process (emotionally) does not feel complete and relaxation does not occur. Any large business can be broken down into medium businesses, and any medium business into small ones. And at each level of scale, there are these stages: beginning, continuation, and end, so that it is easy to follow and understand. It is worth mastering on a small scale, then on a medium scale, and then on a large scale.

### Further directions will depend on what are my needs and what are my limits, interests and desires<br>
It means firstly I need to move in these directions before starting the next ones.

### It became clear that the foundation for everything is the body, "a healthy mind in a healthy body."
