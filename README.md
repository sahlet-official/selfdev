### Repository for organizing self-development process


I really interested in dive into the topic of self-development.

I tried to search the Internet for methodologies and best practices for self-development.<br>

I have seen how people write about how to make and reach goals, make themselves better, be successful and other strange things to me.
It is all not meaningless, but it is just the small part of an iceberg that cannot stay afloat without a huge underwater invisible part.
Besides goals and achievements in life, there are still a lot of things that are much more significant, valuable and interesting.

Comparing self-development process to process of site creation - if you will focus on goals and success, then you draw design of your client-side (Frontend), but you will still need big amount of work for creating server-side (Backend). And now let's see how the development of the site differs from the development of person itself: to create backend part of site you can hire one more software developer, tell him what to do, and he will do it for you. But to make real self-development maximum who you can hire is a set of consultants and coaches - it means you have to do main job by yourself, nobody except you can't change you, of course, if we discard the direct effect on the body due to surgical or medical intervention.<br>

That is why we see such cases when people not accept themselves, run to consultants, sometimes it helps (and it is really good when consultant can help you), and if consultants can not help some people try to fix their bodies with hope that after fix they will accept themselves. I will say you even more, when people unsatisfied, sometimes they can suffer, and it can push them to do things that even they themselves would not wish such things on anyone, for example: drug use, suicide, crime. So when unprepared people want to develop themselves and read about methodologies written in terminology like goals and success, for most part of these people it this will lead to an attempt to harness themselves and at the same time beckon them with a carrot and beat them in the ass with a whip, and so on until you are blue in the face.

Use direction rather goal. When you're trying to achieve a goal - you are learning how to get closer to a goal and focus on future, when you choose direction - you are learning how to walk and focus on now. The reason of such approach is because of you don't try to achieve something, no, you just do, so if you can enjoy the current process it is much better than you try to achieve something. I see goal achieving process kind of not stable - you focus on your goal and can forget about anything else, unlike just walk selected way with no matter at what speed, if you select comfort tempo and you are able to feel happy just like that - in my opinion this is the best way to live.

I want to start my self-development process not by setting my goals (not hang a carrot in front of me and dream about the taste of it) and then try to achieve them in the spirit of the traditional racers for success phrase "fake it until you make it". No. I don't want to look like successful. I actually even don't want to be successful (in terms of society). I want just live life with pleasure, be happy right now in living process and feel that it is enough (not waiting for something). And if I want to do something - than there is no reasons to do nothing. Just do what I want and the way I like, or nothing at all (which is also cool thing actually - just live and do nothing).<br>
So I want to start with creating of really powerful strong foundation - create my "Backend" that will allow me to make the "Frontend" whatever I want. If saying in allegories: on such foundation I will be able to launch rockets, build skyscraper, malls, or just live like that and with time the foundation will be overgrown with forest (do nothing and see what's happening).

Why manage self-development on GitHub?<br>
I am software developer and GitHub is just comfortable to me.<br>
It is also convenient to use tools for self-development like project management that GitHub provide now.<br>
<br>
I invite everyone who interested to view the process of my self-development.<br>
Let's exchange experience, ask questions, share the best practice.<br>
