### What exactly does foundation mean?

#### Build foundation - means setup following processes:

1. Practice
   - Practice exercises for:
     - to impact cognitive functions;
     - to choose and develop a mindset (principles) that will allow me to define the foundation to live life as I want, and for everything that I do, in a sense, a religion built not on dogmas, but on naturally formed regularities obtained by personal experience or provable ways;
     - to develop acceptance;
     - to be able to manage the degree to which an environment influences my mental and emotional state;
     - to feel the sufficiency of satisfaction of basic needs;
     - to see the choice and to make a choice to do something extra (besides satisfying basic needs) or not;
   - Suppose it will be mindfulness. Actually I am already available to be happy - mindfulness helped with it. I have practiced mindfulness for about a year and a half and have one year break. I have learned a lot over time with and without practice. Feel great potential for further development in this direction.
2. Needs understanding
   - Set up a deep understanding of people's needs, use the knowledge in practice for my life, recognize a need and satisfy it directly.
3. Health
   - Set up processes for maintaining physical and mental health and system of crisis prevention.
   - Develop and integrate behavior templates that will allow me to maintain health.
   - Monitor well-being. Monitor the number of parameters that allow timely detection or even prevention of deviation from the desired healthy state.
4. Limits understanding, predispositions, talents, cautions
   - Find out what I can do, what is recommended doing (allowed), and what is not recommended. What are my limits, character, temperament, what lifestyle is optimal for me according to my initial parameters (health, type of nervous system, genetic predisposition, susceptibility to disease, and some other parameters...).
5. Soft Skills
   - Set up skills of communication with people (soft skills..., emotional intelligence, oratory, rhetoric).
   - Set up skills related to perception, processing, filtering, storage and reproduction of information.
   - Set up skills related to learning and adaptation.

### Further directions will depend on what are my needs and what are my limits<br>
It means firstly I need to move in these directions before starting the next ones.
